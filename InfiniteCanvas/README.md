## Building APK for Android

### Method 1: Using EAS Build (Recommended)

1. Install EAS CLI:
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

2. Configure your Expo account:
```bash
eas login
```

3. Configure the project:
```bash
eas build:configure
```

4. Build APK:
```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

### Method 2: Local Build

1. Install Expo CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

2. Prebuild the project:
```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

3. Navigate to android folder:
```bash
cd android
```

4. Build APK:
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK will be located at:
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Method 3: Using Expo (Deprecated but simpler)
